    title: "To the freshers reading this: Here's what I wish I knew in my 1st year 🎓",
    content: `1. Stop trying to impress everyone. Build genuine connections, not just clout.
2. Don’t ignore coding or communication skills — both are more useful than GPA in the long run.
3. Start building something — anything. Even a small website. That portfolio will save you.
4. Join clubs, but don’t get consumed by them. They can help your resume but won’t define your career.
5. Lastly, take care of your mental health. Exams are temporary, burnout can be long-lasting.`,

    title: "How my final year project actually helped me land a job 💼",
    content: `So my team built a budget tracker app during final year using React and Firebase (kind of like this site lol).  
I posted the project on GitHub and later used it as a demo in interviews.  
One recruiter literally said, “This shows you’ve built something real, not just textbook stuff.”  
If you’re still in college, don’t sleep on your final project. Make it clean, host it online, and write a good README.  
It might just be what sets you apart from 200 other resumes.`,

    content: `When I graduated, I thought I'd get a job within a month. That month turned into four.  
I started questioning my degree, my choices, everything. It wasn’t even about money — it was about feeling lost.  
Everyone on LinkedIn looked like they had it figured out, and I felt like the only one failing.  
But slowly, I figured out what I liked (front-end dev), took a few online courses, and kept applying.  
If you’re struggling post-grad, just know that it’s normal. You’re not alone, and you’re not behind.`,

I save so much time (and money) without commuting, but it also feels super isolating sometimes.  
In college, I was always surrounded by people, now I go days without any real social interaction.  
Anyone else feel like it’s harder to stay motivated at home? Or do y’all love the flexibility?  
Drop your experiences — remote, hybrid, or full-time office. Curious what other JU alumni think.`,

What skill has actually helped you most in your career post-JU? For me, it wasn't coding.  
It was **Google Sheets** and **writing clean emails** 😭. No one warned me how important basic documentation would be.  
Also — networking. Talking to seniors helped me land internships more than any placement talk did.  
Share yours — could help current students and even us lost alumni trying to switch paths.`,
